# Test Implementation - Unit & Integration Tests

This document outlines the comprehensive test implementation for Step 6 of the PLP Portal project, covering backend validation rules, frontend component logic, and end-to-end form flow testing.

## ðŸ“‹ Test Coverage Overview

### âœ… Completed Test Suites

#### 1. Backend Unit Tests - Field Value DTO
**Location:** `src/lib/dto/__tests__/field-value.dto.test.ts`

**Coverage:**
- âœ… Validation rules for Field 20/21 conditional logic
- âœ… Serialization of field values based on field types
- âœ… Field response serialization with conditional visibility
- âœ… Input validation for different field types (BINARY, MONTHLY_COUNT, etc.)
- âœ… Storage preparation with conditional null forcing
- âœ… Error handling and validation error types

**Key Test Scenarios:**
```typescript
// Field 20 (elderly_support_group_formed) always exposed
âœ… Always expose Field 20 regardless of value
âœ… Validate Field 20 binary values (true/false, 1/0, '1'/'0')

// Field 21 (elderly_support_group_activity) conditionally exposed
âœ… Hide Field 21 when Field 20 is false
âœ… Show Field 21 when Field 20 is true
âœ… Force null storage for Field 21 when Field 20 is false
âœ… Allow proper storage for Field 21 when Field 20 is true

// Validation rules
âœ… Reject Field 21 input when Field 20 is false (CONDITIONAL_LOGIC_ERROR)
âœ… Allow Field 21 input when Field 20 is true
âœ… Validate numeric ranges and types
âœ… Handle different truthy/falsy values for Field 20
```

#### 2. Backend Integration Tests - Health Data API
**Location:** `src/app/api/health-data/__tests__/route.test.ts`

**Coverage:**
- âœ… POST endpoint for health data submission
- âœ… GET endpoint for health data retrieval
- âœ… Authentication and authorization checks
- âœ… Field 20/21 conditional validation in API layer
- âœ… Facility access control
- âœ… Error handling for various scenarios
- âœ… Remuneration calculation integration

**Key Test Scenarios:**
```typescript
// Successful operations
âœ… Submit health data with proper validation
âœ… Handle Field 20/21 conditional logic in submission
âœ… Retrieve health data with proper access control
âœ… Continue on remuneration calculation failure

// Error scenarios
âœ… Return 401 for unauthenticated requests
âœ… Return 400 for missing required fields
âœ… Return 404 for non-existent facility
âœ… Return 403 for facility user accessing wrong facility
âœ… Handle admin role access to any facility
```

#### 3. Frontend Component Tests - Dynamic Form
**Location:** `src/components/forms/__tests__/DynamicHealthDataForm.test.tsx`

**Coverage:**
- âœ… Component visibility logic for Field 20/21
- âœ… Form submission payload structure
- âœ… User interaction handling
- âœ… Loading states and error handling
- âœ… Field grouping and indicator display
- âœ… Worker selection integration

**Key Test Scenarios:**
```typescript
// Visibility Logic
âœ… Render form with loading state initially
âœ… Load field mappings and render form fields
âœ… Handle Field 20/21 conditional visibility logic
âœ… Clear Field 21 value when Field 20 is set to false
âœ… Render numeric counter for Field 21 when group is formed

// Submission Logic
âœ… Submit form with correct payload structure
âœ… Handle Field 21 submission when Field 20 is false
âœ… Handle API errors gracefully
âœ… Disable form during submission
âœ… Call onSubmissionSuccess callback on successful submission

// Component Integration
âœ… Group fields by indicators correctly
```

#### 4. End-to-End Tests - Form Flow
**Location:** `src/__tests__/e2e/form-flow.test.ts`

**Coverage:**
- âœ… Complete form flow for YES branch (elderly group formed)
- âœ… Complete form flow for NO branch (elderly group not formed)
- âœ… State transitions between YES/NO
- âœ… Error handling throughout the flow
- âœ… Performance and loading states

**Key Test Scenarios:**
```typescript
// YES Branch Flow
âœ… Complete full form submission when elderly group is formed
- Enable elderly support group
- Fill in activity count using counter controls
- Fill in other numeric fields
- Select workers
- Submit form with correct payload
- Verify API calls and payload structure

// NO Branch Flow
âœ… Complete full form submission when elderly group is not formed
- Keep elderly support group disabled (default)
- Verify activity field remains disabled and empty
- Fill in other non-conditional fields
- Submit form with Field 21 forced to null
- Verify correct payload structure

// State Transitions
âœ… Handle YES -> NO -> YES transitions correctly
âœ… Preserve other field values during YES/NO transitions
âœ… Clear Field 21 when transitioning from YES to NO
âœ… Reset Field 21 to 0 when transitioning back to YES

// Error Scenarios
âœ… Handle network errors during form submission gracefully
âœ… Handle server validation errors
âœ… Show proper loading states throughout the flow
```

## ðŸš€ Running the Tests

### Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Backend unit tests (validation & serialization)
npm run test:unit

# Backend integration tests (API routes)
npm run test:integration

# Frontend component tests
npm run test:components

# End-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Comprehensive Test Runner

```bash
# Run all test suites in sequence
npm run test:comprehensive

# Run all tests with coverage report
npm run test:comprehensive:coverage

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

### Custom Test Runner

The project includes a custom test runner (`test-runner.js`) that:
- Runs all test suites in logical order
- Provides colored output and progress tracking
- Generates comprehensive summary reports
- Supports coverage generation
- Handles test failures gracefully

## ðŸ”§ Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration
- **Environment:** Mixed (node for backend, jsdom for frontend)
- **Setup:** `jest.setup.js` with mocks for Next.js components
- **Transform:** SWC for TypeScript/JSX compilation
- **Module mapping:** Absolute imports via `@/*` paths
- **Coverage:** HTML and text reporters

### Mock Strategy
- **Next.js:** Navigation and authentication components
- **External APIs:** Fetch requests and database operations  
- **Child Components:** Focused testing on specific component logic
- **Toast Notifications:** Sonner toast library

## ðŸ“Š Test Metrics

### Coverage Targets
- **Backend DTO:** 95%+ line coverage
- **API Routes:** 90%+ line coverage

- **Integration Tests:** < 500ms each
- **Full Test Suite:** < 30 seconds

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Testing Principles Applied

### 1. **Conditional Logic Testing**
- Exhaustive testing of Field 20/21 dependency
- All possible state combinations verified
- Edge cases for truthy/falsy value handling

### 2. **API Contract Testing**
- Request/response structure validation
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Error response format consistency

### 3. **User Journey Testing**
- Complete form submission flows
- State persistence during user interactions
- Error recovery and user feedback

### 4. **Component Isolation**
- Focused testing with minimal dependencies
- Mock child components for clarity
- Clear separation of concerns

## ðŸ›  Development Workflow

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing test file naming conventions
2. Use descriptive test names explaining the scenario
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Add to the test runner configuration if needed

### Test-Driven Development
1. Write failing tests for new features
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests
3. Refactor while maintaining test coverage
4. Verify end-to-end integration

### Debugging Tests
1. Use `--verbose` flag for detailed output
2. Run individual test files during development
3. Use `console.log` sparingly in tests
4. Leverage Jest's built-in debugging features

## ðŸ“ˆ Continuous Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Run linting and type checking
- Execute fast unit tests
- Verify no test files are broken

### CI Pipeline Integration
- Full test suite execution
- Coverage report generation
- Test result artifacts
- Failure notifications
