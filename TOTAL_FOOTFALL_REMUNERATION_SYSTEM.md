# Total Footfall Remuneration System

## 🎯 Overview

The PLP Portal implements a sophisticated remuneration system for the **Total Footfall (M&F)** indicator that calculates performance-based payments based on achievement against the 3%-5% target range.

## 📊 Requirements Analysis

### ✅ **Current Schema Capabilities**

The existing database schema **fully supports** the remuneration requirements:

1. **Numerator/Denominator Fields**: ✅ Already implemented

   - `MonthlyHealthData.numerator` - Total footfall submitted by facility
   - `MonthlyHealthData.denominator` - Catchment population submitted by facility

2. **Facility Type Specific Remuneration**: ✅ Already implemented

   - `FacilityTypeRemuneration` - Different total amounts per facility type
   - `IndicatorRemuneration` - Different amounts per indicator per facility type

3. **Percentage Range Calculations**: ✅ Enhanced implementation

   - `PERCENTAGE_RANGE` formula type with 3%-5% logic
   - Proportional remuneration between minimum and maximum thresholds

4. **Flexible Target Configuration**: ✅ Already implemented
   - `Indicator.target_type` and `Indicator.formula_config`
   - Support for various formula types and configurations

## 🧮 Remuneration Calculation Logic

### **Formula: "upto 3%-5%"**

The system implements the following **linear progression** logic:

```
If achievement < 3%:
  Remuneration = Rs. 0 (No payment)

If achievement >= 5%:
  Remuneration = Full amount (PHC: Rs. 500, UPHC: Rs. 2000)

If 3% <= achievement < 5%:
  Linear progression from 60% to 100% of remuneration
  3% = 60% of remuneration
  4% = 80% of remuneration  
  5% = 100% of remuneration
```

### **Examples**

#### **PHC (Maximum: Rs. 500)**

| Achievement | Remuneration | Calculation |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| 2.5% | Rs. 0 | Below 3% |
| 3.0% | Rs. 300 | 60% of Rs. 500 |
| 4.0% | Rs. 400 | 80% of Rs. 500 |
| 5.0% | Rs. 500 | 100% of Rs. 500 |
| 6.0% | Rs. 500 | Capped at Rs. 500 |

#### **UPHC (Maximum: Rs. 2000)**

| Achievement | Remuneration | Calculation |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| 2.5% | Rs. 0 | Below 3% |
| 3.0% | Rs. 1200 | 60% of Rs. 2000 |
| 4.0% | Rs. 1600 | 80% of Rs. 2000 |
| 5.0% | Rs. 2000 | 100% of Rs. 2000 |
| 6.0% | Rs. 2000 | Capped at Rs. 2000 |

## 🗄️ Database Schema Support

### **Key Tables**

1. **`MonthlyHealthData`**

   ```sql
   numerator     DECIMAL(15,2)  -- Total footfall (facility submits)
   denominator   DECIMAL(15,2)  -- Catchment population (facility submits)
   achievement   DECIMAL(5,2)   -- Calculated percentage
   ```

2. **`FacilityTypeRemuneration`**

   ```sql
   facility_type_id  STRING      -- PHC, UPHC, etc.
   total_amount      DECIMAL(10,2) -- Rs. 500 for PHC, Rs. 2000 for UPHC
   ```

3. **`IndicatorRemuneration`**

   ```sql
   facility_type_remuneration_id INT
   indicator_id                  INT
   base_amount                   DECIMAL(10,2) -- Amount for this indicator
   ```

4. **`Indicator`**
   ```sql
   formula_type    PERCENTAGE_RANGE
   formula_config  JSON           -- {"range": {"min": 3, "max": 5}}
   target_formula  "upto 3%-5%"
   ```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Enhanced Formula Calculator**

The `calculatePercentageRange` method in `formula-calculator.ts` has been enhanced with **linear progression**:

```typescript
private static calculatePercentageRange(
  submittedValue: number,
  targetValue: number,
  maxRemuneration: number,
  config: FormulaConfig
): CalculationResult {
  const { min, max } = config.range || { min: 3, max: 5 };
  const achievement = (submittedValue / targetValue) * 100;

  // Below minimum threshold - no remuneration
  if (achievement < min) {
    return { achievement: 0, remuneration: 0, status: "INELIGIBLE" };
  }

  // At or above maximum threshold - full remuneration
  if (achievement >= max) {
    return { achievement: 100, remuneration: maxRemuneration, status: "FULL_ACHIEVEMENT" };
  }

  // Linear progression calculation within range (3%-5%)
  // 3% = 60% of remuneration, 4% = 80%, 5% = 100%
  const range = max - min; // 5 - 3 = 2
  const achieved = achievement - min; // e.g., 4% - 3% = 1%
  const percentageWithinRange = (achieved / range) * 100; // 1/2 * 100 = 50%
  
  // Convert to linear progression: 0% range = 60% remuneration, 100% range = 100% remuneration
  const linearPercentage = 60 + (percentageWithinRange * 0.4); // 60% + (50% * 0.4) = 80%
  const remuneration = (linearPercentage / 100) * maxRemuneration;

  return {
    achievement: linearPercentage,
    remuneration: Math.round(remuneration),
    status: "PARTIAL_ACHIEVEMENT"
  };
}
```

### **Setup Scripts**

   - Creates/updates the total footfall indicator
   - Configures 3%-5% formula
   - Sets up numerator/denominator fields

2. **`setup-total-footfall-remuneration.ts`**
   - Configures remuneration amounts per facility type

## 📋 Data Submission Process

### **Facility Data Entry**

Facilities submit two values:

1. **Total Footfall (M&F)** - Number of patients seen
2. **Total Catchment Population** - Population in their catchment area

### **Example Submission**

```
Facility: PHC Example
Month: January 2024
Total Footfall: 40 patients
Catchment Population: 1000 people
Achievement: 40/1000 = 4%
Remuneration: 50% of Rs. 500 = Rs. 250
```

## 🎯 Validation & Testing

### **Test Scenarios**

The system has been tested with various scenarios:

- ✅ Below 3%: No remuneration
- ✅ At 3%: Start of range (0% remuneration)
- ✅ At 4%: Middle of range (50% remuneration)
