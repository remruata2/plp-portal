## üìä **API Response Structure**

The facility reports API now returns comprehensive data:

```typescript
{
  reportMonth: "2025-08",
  totalIncentive: 17000,           // Facility indicator incentives
  totalWorkerRemuneration: 53333,  // Total worker remuneration
  totalRemuneration: 70333,        // Total facility + worker remuneration
  performancePercentage: 66.7,     // Overall performance percentage
  indicators: [...],               // Indicator performance data
  healthWorkers: [                 // Health Workers remuneration
    {
      id: 1,
      name: "Dr. John Smith",
      worker_type: "health_worker",
      allocated_amount: 15000,
      performance_percentage: 66.7,
      calculated_amount: 10000.00
    }
  ],
  ayushWorkers: [                  // AYUSH Workers remuneration

    }
  ],
  summary: {
    totalIndicators: 24,
    achievedIndicators: 16,
    partialIndicators: 4,
    notAchievedIndicators: 4,
    healthWorkersCount: 3,
    ayushWorkersCount: 3

   3. Nurse Mary Wilson
      Allocated: ‚Çπ12,000
      Performance: 66.7%
      Calculated: ‚Çπ8,000

üßò AYUSH Workers:
   1. Dr. Rajesh Kumar
      Allocated: ‚Çπ13,000
      Performance: 66.7%
      Calculated: ‚Çπ8,667
   2. Dr. Priya Sharma

   3. Dr. Amit Patel
      Allocated: ‚Çπ13,500
      Performance: 66.7%
      Calculated: ‚Çπ9,000
```

## üí∞ **Calculation Logic**

### **Performance-Based Remuneration**

```typescript
// Calculate performance percentage based on indicator achievements
const performancePercentage = (achievedIndicators / totalIndicators) * 100;

// Calculate worker remuneration
const calculatedAmount = (allocatedAmount * performancePercentage) / 100;
```

### **Example Calculation**

- **Total Indicators**: 24
- **Achieved Indicators**: 16
- **Performance Percentage**: (16/24) \* 100 = 66.7%
- **Worker Allocated Amount**: ‚Çπ15,000
- **Calculated Amount**: ‚Çπ15,000 \* 66.7% = ‚Çπ10,000
