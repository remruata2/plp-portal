# Indicator Update Summary - Individual Files Alignment

## üìä **Overview**

This document summarizes the changes made to align the PLP Portal implementation with the updated individual indicators source files.

## ‚úÖ **Changes Implemented**

### **1. Database Schema Updates**

**File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`

**Added**:
- `source_of_verification` field to Indicator model
  - Type: `String? @db.VarChar(100)`
  - Purpose: Track where data comes from (e.g., "AAM Portal", "HMIS", "e-Sanjeevani")

### **2. Indicator Seed Script Updates**

**File**: `prisma/seed-indicators-from-fields.ts`

**Updated**:
- Added `source_of_verification` field to all 24 indicators
- Updated facility type mappings based on individual files
- Added missing "NCD Diagnosed & Tx completed" indicator for PHC
- Updated target formulas to match individual files
- Added source verification tracking for all indicators

### **3. Source of Verification Mapping**

**Implemented for all indicators**:

| Indicator | Source of Verification |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Total Footfall (M&F) | AAM Portal |
| Total Wellness sessions | AAM Portal |
| No of Prakriti Parikshan conducted | State report |
| Teleconsultation | e-Sanjeevani |
| Total ANC footfall | HMIS |
| Pregnant women tested for Hb | HMIS |
| Individuals screened for TB | TB Cough App |
| Household visited for TB contact tracing | Nikshay |
| No. of TB patients visited for Differentiated TB Care | Nikshay |
| RI sessions held | U-Win |
| RI footfall | U-Win |
| CBAC filled for the month | NCD Portal |
| HTN screened for the month | NCD Portal |
| DM screened for the month | NCD Portal |
| Oral Ca. Screened for the month | NCD Portal |
| Breast & Cervical Ca. screened for the month | NCD Portal |
| NCD Diagnosed & Tx completed | NCD Portal |
| Patient satisfaction score for the month | QA Mizoram KPI dashboard |
| No of Elderly & Palliative patients visited | HMIS |
| No of Elderly clinic conducted | HMIS |
| Whether Elderly Support Group (Sanjivini) is formed | Patient Support Group Register |
| If Yes, any activity conducted during the month | Patient Support Group Register |
| No of JAS meeting conducted | AAM portal |
| No. of issues generated in DVDMS | DVDMS portal |

### **4. Facility Type Coverage**

**Updated based on individual files**:

#### **A-HWC (Ayush)**: 23 indicators ‚úÖ
- All 23 indicators implemented
- Source verification added
- Worker allocations maintained

#### **PHC**: 21 indicators ‚úÖ
- All 21 indicators implemented (including missing "NCD Diagnosed & Tx completed")
- Source verification added
- Worker allocations maintained

#### **UPHC**: 9 indicators ‚úÖ
- All 9 indicators implemented
- Source verification added
- Worker allocations maintained

#### **U-HWC (Urban)**: 10 indicators ‚úÖ
- All 10 indicators implemented
- Source verification added
- Worker allocations maintained

#### **SC-HWC (Sub Centre)**: 22 indicators ‚úÖ
- All 22 indicators implemented
- Source verification added
- Worker allocations maintained

## üéØ **Key Improvements**

### **1. Data Source Tracking**
- **Before**: No tracking of where data comes from
- **After**: Each indicator has specific source of verification
- **Benefit**: Better data quality and audit trail

### **2. Facility-Specific Logic**
- **Before**: All indicators applied to all facility types
- **After**: Indicators mapped to specific facility types based on individual files
- **Benefit**: More accurate facility-specific configurations

### **3. Missing Indicator Added**
- **Before**: Missing "NCD Diagnosed & Tx completed" for PHC
- **After**: Added with proper facility type mapping (PHC, UPHC)
- **Benefit**: Complete indicator coverage

### **4. Enhanced Metadata**
- **Before**: Basic indicator information
- **After**: Rich metadata including source verification, conditions, and facility-specific targets
- **Benefit**: Better understanding and management of indicators

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

### **Phase 1: Testing** ‚úÖ
- [x] Database schema updated
- [x] Seed script updated and tested
- [x] All indicators updated with source verification

### **Phase 2: Frontend Updates** üîÑ
- [ ] Update indicator forms to display source verification
- [ ] Update indicator display with facility-specific information
- [ ] Add source verification to indicator details

### **Phase 3: Backend Logic** üîÑ
- [ ] Update auto-calculation engine with facility-specific targets
- [ ] Update formula calculator with individual file formulas
- [ ] Add source verification tracking in calculations

### **Phase 4: Validation** üîÑ
- [ ] Test all indicators against individual files
- [ ] Verify calculations match individual file requirements
- [ ] Test facility-specific logic

## üìù **Technical Details**

### **Database Migration**
```sql
-- Added to Indicator model
ALTER TABLE "indicator" ADD COLUMN "source_of_verification" VARCHAR(100);
```

### **Seed Script Changes**
```typescript
// Added to all indicators
{
  source_of_verification: "AAM Portal", // Example
  // ... other fields
}
```

### **Prisma Schema Update**
```prisma
model Indicator {
  // ... existing fields
  
  // Source of verification - where data comes from
  source_of_verification String?  @db.VarChar(100) // e.g., "AAM Portal", "HMIS", "e-Sanjeevani"
  
  // ... rest of model
}
```

## üéØ **Benefits Achieved**

1. **Complete Coverage**: All indicators from individual files are now implemented
2. **Data Quality**: Source verification tracking for better audit trails
3. **Facility-Specific**: Accurate mapping based on individual facility type files
4. **Enhanced Metadata**: Rich information for better indicator management
5. **Future-Proof**: Flexible structure for adding more metadata

## üìä **Status**

- ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: Updated with source_of_verification field
- ‚úÖ **Seed Script**: Updated with all individual file data
- ‚úÖ **Indicators**: All 24 indicators updated with source verification
- üîÑ **Frontend**: Pending updates to display new information
- üîÑ **Backend Logic**: Pending updates for facility-specific calculations
- üîÑ **Testing**: Pending comprehensive testing

## üéØ **Conclusion**

The implementation has been successfully updated to align with the individual indicators source files. The main improvements include:

1. **Complete indicator coverage** with all 24 indicators
2. **Source verification tracking** for better data quality
3. **Facility-specific mappings** based on individual files
4. **Enhanced metadata** for better indicator management

The field-based architecture remains intact while adding the missing functionality from the individual indicators files.
