- Data validation and approval workflow

### **3. Data Validation**

- Range validation for numeric fields
- Required field validation
- Cross-field validation (e.g., ANC tested â‰¤ ANC footfall)

### **4. Reporting**

- Monthly submission status
- Data completeness reports
- Performance tracking dashboards

## Field Usage by Indicator

### **Numerator Fields (Facility Input)**

- All facility-submitted monthly counts
- Binary fields for Yes/No activities

### **Denominator Fields (Admin Input)**

- Population data
- Patient lists
- Target values

### **Target Fields (Hardcoded)**

## Summary

- **32 Total Fields** (removed 13 target fields)
- **11 Fields require Admin input** (population data, patient lists)
- **22 Fields require Facility input** (monthly activities, binary responses)
- **0 Fields are hardcoded** (target values moved to formula_config)

The system needs forms for both admin and facility users to input their respective data, while target values are stored in the indicator's formula_config for consistency.
